def reweight(basis, lag, maxlag=None, guess=None, test_basis=None):
    """Estimate the change of measure to the invariant distribution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    basis : list of (n_frames[i], n_basis) ndarray or sparse matrix of float
        Basis for estimating the change of measure.
    lag : int
        Lag time in unit of frames.
    maxlag : int
        Number of frames at the end of each trajectory that are required
        to have zero weight. This is the maximum lag time the output
        weights can be used with by other methods.
    guess : list of (n_frames[i],) ndarray of float, optional
        Guess for the change of measure. The last maxlag frames of
        each trajectory must be zero.
        If None, use uniform weights (except for the last lag frames).
    test_basis : list of (n_frames[i], n_basis) ndarray of float, optional
        Test basis against which to minimize the error. Must have the
        same dimension as the basis used to estimate the change of
        measure. If None, use the basis that is used to estimate the
        change of measure.

    Returns
    -------
    list of (n_frames[i],) ndarray
        Estimate of the change of measure at each frame of the
        trajectory.
